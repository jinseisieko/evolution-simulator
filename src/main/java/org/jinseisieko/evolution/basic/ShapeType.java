/**
 * Enumerates the supported geometric shape types that can be rendered by the {@link org.jinseisieko.evolution.view.Viewport}.
 * <p>
 * Each constant corresponds to a visual primitive (e.g., circle, square) that a {@link org.jinseisieko.evolution.shape.Drawable}
 * object may use to represent itself during rendering. The {@code Viewport} uses this type to decide
 * which drawing routine (e.g., {@code drawOval}, {@code drawRect}) to invoke.
 * <p>
 * This enum is intentionally minimal and extensibleâ€”new shape types can be added as needed,
 * provided the {@code Viewport} is updated to handle them in its rendering logic.
